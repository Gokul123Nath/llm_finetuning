Tailoring the open source LLMs to perform specific task.
The language model is a type of machine learning that is designed to predict the next word in a sentence,

Supervised Finetuning :

        Text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis

Few - shot learning :

        By providing a few examples (shots) of the required tasks at the begining of the input prompts.

Transfer learning :

        All the above are transfer learning. But this category specifically aimed to allow a model to perform a task different from
        the task it was iinitially trained on. The main idea is to leverage the knowledge the model has gained from a large,
        general dataset and apply it to a more specific or related task.
    
Domain specific Finetuning :

        This type of Finetuning adapt the model to understand and generate text that is specific to particular domain or industry.
        The model is finetuned on a dataset composed of texts from the target domain to improve its context and knowledge on domain
        specific tasks.
